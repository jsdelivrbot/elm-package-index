The goal would be to write a script that can generate an API for the tailwind library. A basic step would be to generate functions for all of the possible classes, and that helps avoid spelling errors and makes it easier to find usages of a class. But a more ideal solution would be to make a more type-safe api, maybe something like this:\n\nTo give types to: <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/spacing/#app>\n\n    spacing : SpacingFlavor -> Side -> SpacingLength -> String\n\n    type SpacingFlavor\n        = Padding\n        | Margin\n        | NegMargin\n\n    type Side\n        = All\n        | Top\n        | Left\n        | Right\n        | Bottom\n        | X\n        | Y\n\n    type SpacingLength\n        = S0\n        | S1\n        | S2\n        | S3\n        | S4\n        | S5\n        | S6\n        | S7\n        | S8\n        | Spx\n        | Sauto\n\nAnd a vertical padding could be expressed like so:\n\n`padding Y S2`\n\n",

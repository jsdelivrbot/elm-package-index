# Elm Devcards

> ## Work in progress.

Devcards aims to provide developers with an interactive visual feedback on the code they are developing. Devcards makes it simple to interactively surface code examples that have a visual aspect into a browser interface.

Highly inspired by [Clojure Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards)

## How to use

Will be added soon.
Currently used internally at [Avisi](http://github.com/avisi).

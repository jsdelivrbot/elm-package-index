# De- and encoding of EDN

[EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) (Extensible Data Notation) is a 
Clojure-derived data transfer format. This project aims to provide EDN 
decoders and encoders for Elm.

The `Decode` and `Encode` modules are modeled on the standard library's 
[`Json.Decode`][1] and [`Json.Encode`][2]

## Status

It's all still a bit rough around the edges, but the parsing and 
decoding should be mostly complete. Some element types are parsed 
correctly but not yet exposed through `Decode`, e.g. arbitrary precision 
numbers.

The encoding module is very much minimal effort so far, falling back to 
possibly incorrect string and number formatting primitives.

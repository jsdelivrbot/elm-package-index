#### Emoji translator and picker

Simple and light Elm package that search from match string on input field and
translate to emoji or else use a emoji picker for your elm app, only contains a
database with a few emojis.

**Still free to contribute with this package. We need tests and more emojis**

The proposal of this package is to add emojis to an web chat opensource make with
Elm and Elixir, promoted by [Yarilabs](http://www.yarilabs.com/).

The chat code links will be soon accessible to the public, and i'll added to
this package ...

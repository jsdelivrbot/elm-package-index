Each time you consume a UUID from the stream,\nthe next UUID will be automatically generated.\n\nThe actual UUID generation is handled by [Zinggi's Uuid library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Zinggi/elm-uuid/1.0.0/Uuid). I suggest you take a\nlook at the documentation for that as it explains how to properly seed the generator so\nyou don't end up with duplicate UUIDs!\n\n@docs UuidStream\n\n\n## Stream Generators\n\n@docs uuidStream, uuidStringStream\n\n\n## Stream Consumers\n\n@docs consume, consumeMany\n\n",

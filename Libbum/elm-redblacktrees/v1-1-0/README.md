# elm-redblacktrees

Red Black Trees are self-balancing binary seach trees which add one bit of
memory to the standard BST (usually denoted by the colours red and black). With
this additional tracking information; the worst case search, insert and delete
time complexity drops to O(log N) [from O(N) in the BST case].

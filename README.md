**This repository contains documentation for all Elm packages that have ever
existed.** The list is generated by cloning the git repository of each
published package and building each tag. The list is updated irregularily until
I figure out a way to built all packages in an hour or less or someone is
willing to sponsor hardware.

Even though there has been a clean-up of packages in the ELm 0.19.0 upgrade of the
package database. There are still problematic packages in the registry:

- platform dependent packages that only compile on Windows since their
  filenames are all lowercase or have unexpected uppercase letters. For example
  `Chadtech/elm-money`. 
- Packages broken through renaming and information duplication in the package JSON
  file. For example `1602/elm-feather v1.0.0` has a repository field in its `elm-package.json`
  incorreclty pointing to `https://github.com/1602/elm-feather-icons.git`.
- Packages targeting a compiler version that do not seem to exist, e.g. Elm `16.1`
  only.

We currently do not detect packages that support Elm 0.18 and Elm 0.19 by
providing a `elm.json` and `elm-package.json` since I am not sure how I should
model the data. (In these cases, only `elm.json` is read.) Please open an issue
if you have an idea.

If you are interested in another metric that I should fetch during crawl, open
an issue.

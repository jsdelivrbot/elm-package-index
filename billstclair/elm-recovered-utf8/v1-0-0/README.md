This package was formerly [spisemisu/elm-utf8](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/spisemisu/elm-utf8/latest), but was deleted from GitHub and recovered as [billstclair/elm-recovered-utf8](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-recovered-utf8/latest).

The original code is now at https://gitlab.com/spisemisu/elm-utf8, but that can't (yet) be referenced from `elm-package.json`.

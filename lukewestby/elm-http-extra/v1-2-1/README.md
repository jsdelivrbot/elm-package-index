# elm-http-extra

Extra helpers for more easily building Http requests that require greater
configuration than what is provided by `elm-http` out of the box.

> Thanks to @fredcy, @rileylark, and @etaque for the original discussion of the API

## Example

```elm
import Time
import Http
import Http.Extra as HttpExtra
import Json.Decode as Json


itemsDecoder : Json.Decoder (List String)
itemsDecoder =
  Json.list Json.string


addItem : String -> Task Http.Error (List String)
addItem item =
  HttpExtra.post "http://example.com/api/items"
    |> withBody (Http.string "{ \"item\": \"" ++ item ++ "\" }")
    |> withHeader ("Content-Type", "application/json")
    |> withTimeout (10 * Time.second)
    |> withCredentials
    |> send itemsDecoder
```

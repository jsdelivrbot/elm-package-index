# Elm-Media

A New, port-based wrapper on the HTML Media API
## Getting Started

This project requires a port (and some other javascript). You can set it up by importing the "Port/mediaPort.js" file into your html file, and doing something like the following:

``` 
    <script src= "Port/mediaPorts.js></script>
    <script>
        var elmApp = Elm.Main.fullscreen();

        MediaApp.Ports.setupElmToJSPort(elmApp.ports.outbound);
        MediaApp.Modify.timeRanges();
        MediaApp.Modify.tracks();

    </script>
```

# Functions to supplement Basics

This package is the home for functions that feel like they should be included in Basics module in elm/core but for one reason or another are not.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. You can expect some kind of response within 1 week.

If you are adding a new function please...

0. Include [documentation](http://package.elm-lang.org/help/documentation-format) and make sure it has a code snippet demonstrating what the function does.
1. Give a detailed use case where your function would come in handy in the PR.

If you are improving existing functions please demonstrate the performance gains in something like [Ellie](https://ellie-app.com/) and by using a benchmark library like [this one](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/BrianHicks/elm-benchmark/latest).

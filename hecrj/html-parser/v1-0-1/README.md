# html-parser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hecrj/html-parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hecrj/html-parser)

Parse HTML 5 in Elm 0.19!

# Warning!

This is very WIP, and it probably has _many_ issues still. I have only
been able to pass the sane tests in the [`jinjor/elm-html-parser`][jinjor] package
for Elm 0.18. Feel free to fork, contribute, add new tests and/or open issues!

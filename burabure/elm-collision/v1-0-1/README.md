# Elm Collision

Detect collision/intersection of geometry in a defined coordinate space, AKA: tell me when objects are touching or overlapping

![elm-collision demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burabure/elm-collision/master/elm-collision.gif)

This library is useful for games, interactive apps, dynamic element composition and other cases where you need efficient detection of overlapping objects

Right now this library supports a small set of 2D operations, but the intent is to keep a powerful set of 2D and 3D operations while maintaining a focused and clear API


### Get Started

- Read the [the documentation][docs].
- Try and read the code of [the examples][examples].

This package aims at handling [pointer events][pointer-events] in elm.
Pointer events are a unified interface for similar input devices
(mouse, pen, touch, ...).

Since maintaining both mouse and touch events for compatibility
is really cumbersome, using a unified pointer events interface
is a relief.
However this API [is not well supported by all browsers][caniuse-pointer].
So I strongly recommend to use it in pair with a the [elm-pep polyfill][elm-pep]
for compatibility with all major browsers.

## Usage

The following functions can easilly be used
to generate attribute messages:

```elm
Pointer.onDown : (Pointer.Event -> msg) -> Html.Attribute msg
Pointer.onMove : (Pointer.Event -> msg) -> Html.Attribute msg
Pointer.onUp : (Pointer.Event -> msg) -> Html.Attribute msg
```

If you are using the [elm-pep][elm-pep] polyfill
for compatibility with Firefox and Safari,
you have to add the `elm-pep` attribute.
It is also recommended that you deactivate `touch-action`
to disable browsers scroll behaviors.


```elm
div
    [ Pointer.onDown ...
    , Pointer.onMove ...
    , Pointer.onUp ...
    -- no touch-action
    , Html.Attributes.style [ ( "touch-action", "none" ) ]
    -- Add this to your list of attribute messages
    , Html.Attributes.attribute "elm-pep" "true"
    ]
    []
```


## Example

An example is available in the `examples/` directory.
To test it, compile the elm file with the command:

```shell
elm-make PointerEvents.elm --output PointerEvents.js
```

Then use any static http server like:

```shell
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

And open your browser at localhost:8888
to load the `index.html` page.
